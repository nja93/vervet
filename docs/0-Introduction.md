# Introduction
## Product Statement
Vervet alerts is a web application who's intent is to have a platform where users can alert other users based on entities called _Feeds_ which users can follow to get updates on.

This harkens back to a time where RSS Feeds were more common place and more often use, but whose usefulness has slightly waned with the rise of social media platforms and their marketing power.

The main goal of this product is to allow users to get exactly what they need without requiring them to waddle through a sea of content that may not be of interest (or harmful). This idea necessitates that the user is aware of the individual/business before patroning it.
